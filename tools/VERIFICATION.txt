What is an IDE distribution?

CoolBeans is not a fork of Apache NetBeans. It is just a distribution, in the same way Ubuntu is a distribution based on Debian.

By taking more control of the user experience as well as having more flexibility with regard to plugins licensing (compared to the Apache Software Foundation) you should have a better tool at your disposal. In time the 3rd party plugins will be vetted more, giving you peace of mind.
